    Cyborg Way - Creating Cybernetic Technologies for Cyborgs.
    We aim to accelerate the emergence of cybernetic technologies, cybernetic bodies, cybernetic minds, cybernetic civilization, as well as expand the physical and mental capabilities of our members so that they can move into a fully cybernetic life form.
    We welcome everyone who shares our mission and is ready to contribute to the development of the community - developers, activists, volunteers, employees, partners, sponsors.
    Join us and together we will create our future!
