<h2 id="header-2" align="center">ROAD MAP & GOALS</h2>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure the well-being of Organization Members by meeting their basic physical needs and creating systems to fulfill them, allowing Organization Members to have more free time to achieve the Organization's goals and actively engaging in its projects.</li>
    <li>Open new research laboratories, support existing research, projects, companies and movements that contribute to the mission of the Organization.</li>
    <li>Create artificial intelligence (AI) that will assist in the development of cybernetic technologies and provide recommendations and solutions that contribute to the mission of the Organization.</li>
    <li>Create technologies of cybernetic implants and prostheses to replace biological analogues and expand the physical capabilities of biological bodies.</li>
    <li>Create technologies of biosensors to collect real-time biodata about the body and ensure continuous monitoring of health and physiological parameters.</li>
    <li>Create technologies of neural interfaces to enhance brain functions, to work directly with computer interfaces with the power of thought, to expand brain memory and instantly download information (learning, skills, languages), to connect to a global network of collective intelligence for exchange knowledge and collaborative decision-making in real time.</li>
    <li>Create a technology of the isolated biological brain, be able to connect to the internet, to electronic sense organs, to any kind of cybernetic bodies, avatars and devices, to virtual platforms for communication and to metaverses.</li>
    <li>Create a technology of cybernetic body suitable for transplanting an isolated biological brain into it.</li>
    <li>Create a technology of cybernetic brain by gradually replacing biological neurons with electronic neurons.</li>
    <li>Create a technology of cybernetic body from nanorobots, which changes shape under the influence of thought and is controlled by the power of thought.</li>
    <li>Create a technology to upgrade consciousness, intelligence, cognitive abilities and memory.</li>
    <li>Create a technology for uploading and transferring consciousness.</li>
    <li>Create a technology of collective and swarm intelligence for cybernetic personalities.</li>
    <li>Create a cyborg extraterritorial contractual jurisdiction (ECJ), obtain recognition of jurisdiction from other states and international organizations, including the United Nations (UN), to ensure the protection of the rights and interests of cyborgs at the international level and promote the development of mutually beneficial cooperation with humans.</li>
    <li>Create and launch colony space stations to keep cybernetic personalities alive in space, outside of planets or other natural space objects with gravity and a biological ecosystem.</li>
