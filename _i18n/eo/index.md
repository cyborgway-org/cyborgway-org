<h2 id="header-2">Tokenomics</h2>
<p>
  We created donation tokens to use the power of cryptocurrencies to fund futuristic cybernetic technologies. Donation tokens can be obtained as a reward for financial donations and help contributions to the Organization. Donation tokens are pegged to fiat currencies in the form of stablecoins and can be freely exchanged among themselves at the market rate.
</p>
<p>
  Token holders get:
  <ul>
    <li>Access to the Stellar Decentralized Exchange (SDEX) to freely trade tokens with other Stellar users.</li>
